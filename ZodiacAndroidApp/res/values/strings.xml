        by a serial killer, known as the Zodiac Killer, to the local Bay Area press
        on November 8, 1969.\n\tThe cryptogram has not been definitively solved and the killer\'s identity 
        remains unknown to this day. </string>

        tap on the symbol and type the letter in the dialog. The symbols will be then automatically replaced by

        can be replaced by the same letter.\n\tSearch Directions - directions in which the words are searched. </string>
    <string name="help_page_5">\tNOTE! The search can be a very resource-consuming operation.
        It is not recommended to search for more than one word, especially on the old devices. </string>
